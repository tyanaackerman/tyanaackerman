      <p>
        I am a passionate and motivated designer and marketer. I am pursuing a
        degree in Marketing and a degree in Visual Communication Design at
        Eastern Washington University in Washington State. My hope is to help
        make a difference in the world, no matter how big or small, in any way I
        can by utilizing my talents of marketing and design. I have worked in
        different retail environments in the past which provided me with several
        skills such as communication, patience, and problem-solving to name a
        few. I have also interned a couple of times at a brand design and
        advertising agency that has offices in both Spokane and Seattle. During
        my time at this agency, I dabbled primarily on the marketing side of the
        company but also a bit on the design side of the company. I attained
        business skills such as working with an array of clientele, along with
        skills that come with being a designer such as resiliency, adaptability,
        and the ability to take critiques. With this exciting and valuable
        experience in my pocket, I am eager to collaborate with or work for
        others by marketing and/or designing in any way I can to help
        individuals or companies accomplish their goals and better themselves or
        their company. My preference of work includes working for anything or
        anyone that works to better the world, environment, people, and/or
        communities. There is a lot of potential for good to be done in this
        world and communities throughout, and I stand for working for good not
        bad and building up not tearing down. I believe in honesty, quality, and
        the ability to listen and learn.
