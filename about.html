          <p>
            I am a passionate and motivated designer and marketer. I am pursuing
            a degree in Marketing and a degree in Visual Communication Design at
            Eastern Washington University in Washington State. My hope is to
            help make a difference in the world, no matter how big or small, in
            any way I can by utilizing my talents of marketing and design. I
            have worked in different retail environments in the past which
            provided me with several skills such as communication, patience, and
            problem-solving to name a few. I have also interned a couple of
            times at a brand design and advertising agency that has offices in
            both Spokane and Seattle. During my time at this agency, I dabbled
            primarily on the marketing side of the company but also a bit on the
            design side of the company. I attained business skills such as
            working with an array of clientele, along with skills that come with
            being a designer such as resiliency, adaptability, and the ability
            to take critiques. With this exciting and valuable experience in my
            pocket, I am eager to collaborate with or work for others by
            marketing and/or designing in any way I can to help individuals or
            companies accomplish their goals and better themselves or their
            company. My preference of work includes working for anything or
            anyone that works to better the world, environment, people, and/or
            communities. There is a lot of potential for good to be done in this
            world and communities throughout, and I stand for working for good
            not bad and building up not tearing down. I believe in honesty,
            quality, and the ability to listen and learn.
