    <p>
      I am a passionate and motivated designer and marketer. I am pursuing a
      degree in Marketing and a degree in Visual Communication Design at Eastern
      Washington University in Washington State. My hope is to help make a
      difference in the world, no matter how big or small, in any way I can by
      utilizing my talents of marketing and design. I have worked in different
      retail environments in the past which provided me with several skills such
      as communication, patience, and problem-solving to name a few. I have also
      interned a couple of times at a brand design and advertising agency that
      has offices in both Spokane and Seattle. During my time at this agency, I
      dabbled primarily on the marketing side of the company but also a bit on
      the design side of the company. I attained business skills such as working
      with an array of clientele, along with skills that come with being a
      designer such as resiliency, adaptability, and the ability to take
      critiques. With this exciting and valuable experience in my pocket, I am
      eager to collaborate with or work for others by marketing and/or designing
      in any way I can to help individuals or companies accomplish their goals
      and better themselves or their company. My preference of work includes
      working for anything or anyone that works to better the world,
      environment, people, and/or communities. There is a lot of potential for
      good to be done in this world and communities throughout, and I stand for
      working for good not bad and building up not tearing down. I believe in
      honesty, quality, and the ability to listen and learn.
